Overall

While this script doesn't implement any real functionality yet (as many methods contain placeholder comments), it provides a well-organized framework to build an extensive impact management system. You would need to fill in the logic for data collection, analysis, visualization, matching algorithms, etc., depending on your specific requirements.

This skeleton serves as a starting point for developing a comprehensive platform for managing and demonstrating the impact of various initiatives.
