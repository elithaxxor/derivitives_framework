# Derivatives Trading Framework - Stage 1: Command Interface

## Overview

**IMPORTANT: This project represents the initial stage (Stage 1) of a larger, modular framework designed for derivatives trading.**

This component is a simple React-based web application that serves as the foundational user interface for interacting with a backend system. In its current state (Stage 1), the application allows users to:

1.  Select a target communication platform (Telegram, WhatsApp, or Discord).
2.  Input a stock ticker symbol.
3.  Send a command instruction, combining the platform and ticker, to a backend server.
4.  Fetch and display logs generated by the backend server.

## Purpose in the Larger Framework

This application provides the basic entry point for user interaction. It establishes the client-server communication pattern and the mechanism for initiating actions based on user input (platform + ticker).

**Future stages of the Derivatives Trading Framework will build upon this foundation**, integrating more sophisticated tools and functionalities. The goal is to develop a comprehensive suite for analysis, strategy development, and potentially execution within the derivatives market.

## Key Features (Stage 1)

* **Platform Selection:** Choose the target messaging platform via a dropdown menu.
* **Ticker Input:** Enter a standard stock ticker symbol.
* **Send Command:** Transmit the selected platform and ticker data to the backend via a POST request.
* **Fetch Logs:** Retrieve logs from the backend via a GET request and display them.

## Technologies Used

* React (using `useState` hook for state management)
* JavaScript (ES6+)
* HTML5
* CSS3 (Basic styling assumed)
* Fetch API (for interacting with the backend)

## Prerequisites

* Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine.
* A running backend server instance accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Backend API Requirements

This frontend application expects the backend server running at `http://localhost:3000` to expose the following endpoints:

1.  **`POST /api/command`**:
    * Accepts a JSON payload containing the selected platform and ticker.
    * Example Payload: `{ "platform": "Telegram", "ticker": "AAPL" }`
    * Responsible for processing the command based on the input.
2.  **`GET /api/data`**:
    * Returns logs from the server.
    * The format is assumed to be an array of strings or objects suitable for display.

## Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

## Running the Application

1.  **Ensure the backend server is running** and accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.
2.  **Start the React development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    # yarn start
    ```
3.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:<port>` (typically `http://localhost:3001` or as indicated in your terminal after running the start command).
4.  Use the interface to select a platform, enter a ticker, send commands, and fetch logs.

## Future Development (Beyond Stage 1)

This foundational interface will be expanded in subsequent stages of the framework. Planned additions and integrations include, but are not limited to:

* **Real-time Data Feeds:** Integration with APIs for live market data (prices, volumes, greeks).
* **Option Chain Visualization:** Tools for displaying and analyzing option chains.
* **Volatility Surface Analysis:** Plotting and interpreting implied volatility.
* **Strategy Builders:** Interfaces for constructing and evaluating derivatives strategies (e.g., spreads, collars, butterflies).
* **Backtesting Engine:** Functionality to test strategies against historical data.
* **Risk Management Dashboard:** Tools for monitoring portfolio risk metrics (e.g., Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta).
* **Enhanced Alerting:** More sophisticated notification triggers and delivery options via the selected platforms.
* **User Authentication & Profiles:** Secure login and personalized settings.
* **Potential Order Execution:** Integration with broker APIs (if applicable and desired).

This README provides a snapshot of Stage 1. As the framework evolves, this documentation will be updated to reflect the growing capabilities.markdown

```markdown
This Python module defines a class `OptionsCalculator` for calculating option prices and Greeks using the Black-Scholes model. The class has the following methods:

    1. `__init__(self, risk_free_rate=0.02)`: Constructor that initializes the risk-free rate.

2. `black_scholes(self, S, K, T, sigma, option_type='call')`: Calculates the option price using the Black-Scholes model for a given stock price `S`, strike price `K`, time to expiration `T`, volatility `sigma`, and option type ('call' or 'put').

3. `calculate_delta(self, S, K, T, sigma, option_type='call')`: Calculates the Delta (Δ) value, which represents the sensitivity of the option price to changes in the underlying stock price.

4. `calculate_gamma(self, S, K, T, sigma)`: Calculates the Gamma (Γ) value, which represents the rate of change of Delta with respect to changes in the underlying stock price.

5. `calculate_vega(self, S, K, T, sigma)`: Calculates the Vega (ν) value, which represents the sensitivity of the option price to changes in volatility.

   The calculations are based on the Black-Scholes formulas for European call and put options. The module uses the `numpy` and `scipy.stats` libraries for mathematical computations.```

Overall

While this script doesn't implement any real functionality yet (as many methods contain placeholder comments), it provides a well-organized framework to build an extensive impact management system. You would need to fill in the logic for data collection, analysis, visualization, matching algorithms, etc., depending on your specific requirements.

This skeleton serves as a starting point for developing a comprehensive platform for managing and demonstrating the impact of various initiatives.
