The `ESGWrapper` class acts as the central interface to the ESG Analytics Toolkit. It simplifies the interaction with different ESG tools, providing a unified access point for all functionalities. This design promotes ease of use and integration into existing workflows.

```python
from esg_toolkit import ESGWrapper

wrapper = ESGWrapper()
data = wrapper.fetch_esg_data("AAPL") # Fetches ESG data for Apple (AAPL)
wrapper.create_and_publish_report(data) # Generates and publishes an ESG report
