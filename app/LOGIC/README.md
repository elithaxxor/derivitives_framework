- Handles division by zero errors gracefully.

## Installation

To use the ROI calculator, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
   cd repo-name
   ```

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install required packages (if any):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python roi_calculator.py
   ```

2. Enter the initial investment when prompted.
3. Enter the total returns when prompted.
4. View the calculated ROI as a percentage.

## Calculation Logic

The ROI is calculated using the following formula:

\[
\text{ROI} = \frac{\text{Net Profit}}{\text{Cost of Investment}} \times 100
\]

Where:
- **Net Profit** = Total Returns - Cost of Investment

## Example

Upon running the script, you could see:

```
Enter the initial investment: 1000
Enter the total returns: 1500
The Return on Investment (ROI) is: 50.00%
```
